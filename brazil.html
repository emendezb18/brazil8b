In addition to its diversity it also is a center of control on the plants climate, the amazon basin stores approximately 100 billion metric tons of carbon, which is more than ten times the annual global emission from fossil fuels. 
        Around 15 million years ago a massive freshwater lake covered the amazon basin, but during the several ice ages, water started to flow to the east from the andes, sea level fell, the lake started to drain out to the ocean, and then the amazon river was created.
        The rainforest is important to Brazil because it contributes about 8.2 billion a year to Brazil's economy economy, from    products including rubber and wood. The rainforest brings rainfall across south america and much of the continent would become hotter and dryer if the rainforest was to be destroyed.

Guides will help you visit and experience the amazon rainforest at its fullest potential while affirming that you visit morally and not damaging to the area or the wildlife. </center></p>

        </p>  
        Entitled as “ the greatest show on earth ” , the Rio Carnival never fails to give anyone an impressive fun party. It can take up to a year to plan, because of how many details there are to it. All the performances are prepared by the best 12 samba schools in Brazil. The choreography and music can last up to 75 minutes each one with a different theme. 
        Although the practice of Carnivals originated from Europe, African influence is evident in today's Brazil's carnivals. This began when Brazil became a colony of Portugal. The carnivals were made by adapting tribal dances which included parading around the village which was done to protect themselves from bad spirits in the area. Then people began to use costumes and tribal masks during the celebrations. 
        It's really important for Brazil, because it's been an important tradition for many years on repeat and it also has a religious spiritual meaning for them. It's one of the biggest attractions in the world. 
        The stadium can seat more than 80,000 people. Their first need is to build a facility for the comfort of tourists and for locals. Before Sambodromo existed, the top samba schools did the parade on the streets of Rio, but this all changed when Rio officials and organizers  said that they needed change for more order. The change was made in 1984. After making Sombodromo there was a huge increase of participants and spectators.
